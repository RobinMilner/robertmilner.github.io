People often rely too much on one way, which is called `debugging' and consists of running a partly-understood program to see if it does what you expected. Another way, which ML advocates, is to install some means of understanding in the very programs themselves."

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robin Milner was born on January 13th, 1934 in Yealmpton, England.  He attended Eton College and began to attend Cambridge university in 1954.  He graduated with a bachelors degree in mathematics 3 years following.  He soon became a computer programmer at Ferranti Ltd.  After Ferranti, he taught math and conducted research into AI.  He contributed in the creation of ML, a computer language that specializes in automated theorem solvers.  In addition to his techonological contributions to society; Milner wrote the book <i>A Calculus for Communicating Systems</i>, <i>Communication and Concurrency</i>,  <i>Comunicating and Mobile Sytems: The Pi-Calculus</i>, <i>The Space and Motion of Communicating Agents</i>, and contributed to other research.  He won the A.M. Turing award in 1991.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robin Milner contributed to the creation of LCF, logic for computable functions, that automated the theorem proving process.  In addition to this, he helped create ML, the language that LCF was built off of.  He also created the calculus of communicating sytems or CCS, which explored concurrency and how to deal with its issues.  Both of these contributions to computer science allowed for quicker use of computational processes.  LCF allowed computer scientist to assist in the proving of math functions, while CCS allowed programmers to avoid problems that would occur with concurrency, and how to fix problems that have already risen up.
